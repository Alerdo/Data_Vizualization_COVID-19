# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project involves analyzing and visualizing COVID-19 data to understand the impact and trends of the pandemic. Below are the steps and key insights derived from the analysis.

## Data Cleansing Step

### 1. Excel File Adjustments
- Removed headers and footers for clarity.
- Unified column headers for consistency.

### 2. Data Processing with Pandas
- Transformed 'Time period April 27/December 18' into "Date Time Period" datetime column.
- Selected the last record of each month to simplify the x-axis in visualizations.

### 3. Visualization and Analysis
- Added confidence intervals for COVID-19 case percentages.
- Corrected data import issues in df_a1 regarding percentage calculations.


### 4. Modifications in Sheet 1E
- Merged columns for improved data handling in Pandas.

### 5. Analysis of Death Rates Excel File
- Created an additional sheet for easy data access.
- Added a column to compare COVID-19 deaths with other causes.
- Converted death rate percentages to numerical values for analysis.

### 6. Enhancements in Data Visualization
- Implemented FuncFormatter in Matplotlib for percentage symbols on y-axes.
- Customized x-axis ticks on bar plots for clearer display of COVID-19 cases.
